Thank you for faithfully using wine-overlay!

At this point, I have become a Gentoo developer and so there is no delay from
me waiting for a Gentoo developer to commit for me.  As such, the primary
purpose of this branch is no longer necessary.  As all of the branches except
for wine-a-holics (which is now a separate overlay) have been deprecated,
there is no reason to keep the overlay around.

As such, if you want to use plain ole wine, you should switch back to using
the versions in Gentoo's repo (which still come from me).  If you are
interested in the additional experimental features of slotting and Ixit's D3D9
state tracker, please switch to the wine-a-holics overlay.  

Thanks for being a supporter all this time.

For more information, if you have questions, or if you'd like help, don't 
hesitate to stop by the #gentoo-wine channel on Freenode's IRC network.
