Thank you for faithfully using wine-overlay!

At this point, the features from all of the branches are either in the process
of being integrated into the main tree or have already been integrated into
the sister overlay, wine-a-holics.

As such, if you want to continue using the features of this branch
without delay, please switch to the wine-a-holics overlay.  

Keep an eye out on the packages in the main tree and wine-overlay, as they
may be getting some of these features soon.

For more information, if you have questions, or if you'd like help, don't 
hesitate to stop by the #gentoo-wine channel on Freenode's IRC network.
